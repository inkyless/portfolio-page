# portfolio-page

Hello! I'm Viola and Welcome to my portfolio website. While the website is still very amateurish, I'll try my best to improve it during the whole learning journey. 

This portfolio is developed using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript**. While I admit I could have used frameworks to make it easier, I do this intentionally to learn deeper about the foundation of HTML and CSS first before decided to go for frameworks.

Check my [CHANGELOG markfown file](CHANGELOG.md) to read what I have experienced on updating this website, thanks for reading!
