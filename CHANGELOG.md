### Update
First push to github repository, settling the necessary pages (Home Page, Projects, Profile, and Contact)
### Issues
- While trying to make responsive design, so far only considering the width range but not on the **height**, which could be fatal on mobile with small size of height. 
- Still could not figuring out the overflow part at the bottom part of the page on desktop size. 
- Due to lack of experience, the "About Me" page is still barely empty with histories. This will be updated when my progressing journey . 
- While the contact pages is set, still unsure if the submit function will work as intended. More testing will be needed. 
- Showcases on Graphic Designs and Web Design is not added yet, will consider adding this sooner. For now, [this link to PDF will be used](https://pdflink.to/96c8564a/)
